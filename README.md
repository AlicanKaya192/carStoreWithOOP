# Vehicle Management System

In this mini project, a simple vehicle management system has been developed. Users can add, list, and remove vehicles. This project employs Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and basic C# features.

#Project Features

#Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project is based on the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). The fundamental concepts of OOP used in this project are:

  - Classes and Objects: A class named Vehicle is defined in the project. This class stores the brand, model, year, and mileage information of a vehicle.
  - Encapsulation: The properties of the Vehicle class (Brand, Model, Year, Mileage) are encapsulated.

Collections

List: A List<Vehicle> collection is used to store vehicles. This collection facilitates the addition, removal, and listing of vehicles.

Methods

Several methods are used in the project:

  - ShowVehicles: Lists the current vehicles.
  - AddVehicle: Adds a new vehicle.
  - RemoveVehicle: Removes a specified vehicle from the list.


User Input

  - Console.ReadLine(): Used to receive input from the user. The user-provided data is used in the vehicle addition and removal processes.

Control Structures

  - Switch-Case: Used to perform different actions based on the user's menu selection.
  - If-Else: Used to check if there are any vehicles in the list and display appropriate messages.

Loops

  - Do-While Loop: Ensures that the menu continuously waits for the user's choice and performs the corresponding actions.
